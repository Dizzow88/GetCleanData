## Reading Data
Data is read from the root file provided into the following data frames:

data.feat: features.txt

data.actv: activity_labels.txt

data.subj.trn: subject_train.txt

data.xtrn: x_train.txt

data.ytrn: y_train.txt

data.subj.tst subject_test.txt

data.xtst x_test.txt

data.ytst: y_test.txt


### 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
Text

### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
